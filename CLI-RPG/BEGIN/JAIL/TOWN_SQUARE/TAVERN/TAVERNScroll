Onto your second mission!!

OK, let's cut to the chase. We understand that your time is sensitive.

There is a worldly merchant in this tavern. We are very fortunate that he is visiting this town , because he carries a lot of valuable information 
about the kingdom (and the world beyond, but we just care about our kingdom, for now).

Now that spring has just arrived, many farmers are arranging to plant their crops for the autumn harvest.

If they knew what crops are in the highest demand in the main market squares in the capital, 
		they would stand to make a huge profit, which would bring alot of money into the town, benefitting everyone.


Your task is to do whatever it takes to get the merchant to tell you about the details of the current agriculture market in the capital.
We don't know what he will ask of you, as he can be a bit eccentric, but trust that it won't be easy.

Now go, hurry up!! Your time is running out!
