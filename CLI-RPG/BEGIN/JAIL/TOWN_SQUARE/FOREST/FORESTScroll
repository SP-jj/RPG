Alright, here's what you have to do...

Deep in the forest, there lives a monstorous snake named Algernon:

               ~--______-~                ~-___-~

He preys on humans that stray too far from the town. Many people have died because of him. 
He is blind, but that does not make him any less dangerous!

Your job is to seek him out and convince him to leave the townspeople alone.
You can do this by bargaining with him for something even more delicious than juicy humans. Apples.

Algernon loves apples, but he cannot find them on his own like he can humans. 

You will offer to help Algernon collect apples. In exchange, you will get him to promise to not hurt any more people.


That's it! Good luck!!!

And remember, you must hurry!
